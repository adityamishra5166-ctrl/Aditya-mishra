ou are my coding assistant.
Build a complete, fully animated developer portfolio using these technologies:
Next.js (latest)
TypeScript
Three.js for 3D visuals + reactive particles
Barba.js for page transitions
GSAP for micro-animations
TailwindCSS (or custom SCSS if needed)
Framer Motion optional for UI transitions (if helpful)
I want a Gen-Z, dark rave, neon-cyber theme with these characteristics:
Dark UI with neon edges (blue, purple, magenta, cyber-green accents)
Glitch effects, scanlines, grain texture overlays
Animated cursor with trailing particles
Smooth physics-based parallax interactions
Page transitions using Barba.js (glitch-warp style)
3D hero section with Three.js (reactive neon particles/mesh)
Rave poster-style typography (bold, wide, futuristic)
📌 SITE STRUCTURE
Build these pages/sections:
1. Homepage
3D neon particle background (Three.js)
My name, title (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer")
Animated intro text (glitch + neon glow)
Floating elements reacting to cursor position
Call-to-action buttons:
“View Projects”
“Get Resume”
“Contact”
2. About Me
My short bio in neon-card layout
Skills section:
Technical skills with animated progress neon bars or radial meters
Tools icons with hover neon pulses
3D model or particle bust behind section (optional)
3. Projects
Grid of 6–8 project cards
Hover animations: neon frame, tilt, parallax
Modal popup for details
Each project should include:
Title
Description
Tech stack
Features

Animated submit button
Socials section (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)

🧠 DELIVERABLES
I want you (Replit AI) to:
Initialize the project
Setup Next.js + TS + Tailwind + GSAP + Barba.js + Three.js.
Generate all components and pages
Use the above structure, theme, and animation requirements.
Create placeholder data
For:
Skills
Education
Experience
Projects
Add high-quality animations & interactions
Ensure everything is responsive & smooth
Comment code cleanly
🔥 IMPORTANT
Code must be clean, modular, reusable.
No filler comments or trash knowledge.
Everything must match Gen-Z rave neon cyber aesthetic.
Use advanced animations, not basic ones.
Give me the full project ready to run.
✅ END OF PROMPT
Copy that into Replit’s coding agent and it will generate your full portfolio setup.
If you want, I can also give you:
✅ a version with your name + real details pre-filled
✅ a version with images, 3D assets, custom shaders
